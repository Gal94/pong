# Pong
My implementation of the classic Pong game as part of learning web sockets.

Click [here](https://node-pong-ws.herokuapp.com) for a demo version of the game. (2 players needed - may lag due to heroku free hosting)

## How to start:
#### After cloning the repo run "npm install" inside the project's directory.
#### Run "npm start" and connect from 2 browser sessions to start the game.
